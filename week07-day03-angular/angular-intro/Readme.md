## Notes on how Angular works:
```shell
bower init
```

```shell
bower install --save angular
```
## Set up index.html
## include angular in the script from bower
## include app.js in script


### within index.html:
Everything in the curly braces is executed.
angular is going to parse the page and look for the curly braces and evaluates whats within it.
